# javascript-practice
This repository will allow me to learn Vanilla JS through practice using The Odin Project. I already know the fundamentals (variables/types, methods/functions, conditionals, loops, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, etc) from C++, Python, and Java so I'll just be learning the JS syntax among other nuances.
